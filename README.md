To deploy `npm run deploy`.

To start local server `npm start`.

To build static resource `grunt prebuild:dev`. Not sure in which case it is automatically built.

To see more commands execute `npm` and check out `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js`.

-- Why 'run' is needed in the first command but not the second?

Because 'start' is a command, 'run' is a command, while 'deploy' is not a command.
